== Description ==

The Bookmark Me plugin will add buttons that let your visitors share your content on social media sites such as Buzz Up!, Delicious, Digg, Facebook, Mixx, Reddit and StumbleUpon.

Share by Email and Print buttons are also added when the plugin is called within the loop.

Hovering the initial set of buttons will reveal many more services. Only major services are included in the complete list of services.

These services are added through the use of widgets. This makes it especially useful for users.

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
